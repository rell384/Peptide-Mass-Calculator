# Peptide Mass Calculator

This notebook contains Python code for calculating the monoisotopic mass of peptides using BioPython and PyOpenMS libraries.

## Prerequisites

Before running the code in this notebook, make sure you have the following libraries installed:

- BioPython
- PyOpenMS

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
!pip install biopython
!pip install pyopenms

Additionally, this code requires the following packages:

numpy
BIO
You can install these packages using pip as well:
!pip install numpy
!pip install BIO
Usage
Open the notebook in a Jupyter environment or Google Colab.
Run the code cells sequentially to calculate the monoisotopic mass of peptides.
Description
The code calculates the monoisotopic mass of a peptide sequence provided as input.
It demonstrates the usage of BioPython and PyOpenMS libraries for peptide mass calculation.
